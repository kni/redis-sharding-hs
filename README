Haskell version of "Redis Sharding" (http://github.com/kni/redis-sharding)

For resharding see http://github.com/kni/redis-sharding.


As opposed to the Perl version, the Haskell version RedisSharding is built in the "lazy style".
If the client is not responding, RedisSharding won't detect closing connection by the server because of time-out.
So, the time-outs execution is added into the RedisSharding itself (timeout keys, seconds).
